# OpenRGB

To control my RGB inside the desktop computer I installed OpenRGB on Windows and enabled the auto start of the OpenRGB server, which allows controlling it via API. 
I then can fire multiple events from Home Assistant allowing me to change to lighting.

*Tested with Aura Sync Lighting*

Example use cases:
- switch to sensor mode where CPU/GPU/Network usage is displayed as color/slider on the fans
- Blink red when CO2 value is high and presence in room detected
- Blink yellow when doorbell rings
